## MyZ80 - Yet another Z80 emulator

This is a project I am writing with the intent to have a Z80 emulator code on my RunCPM and at the same time use the same code as a model on Proteus.

The code is still in its infancy, but some of the Z80 instructions are already working.

There's still a lot to be done, but it is here in case anyone is interested.

The method I am using to emulate the Z80 is the one described on http://www.z80.info/decoding.htm
